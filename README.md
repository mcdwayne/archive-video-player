## A Drupal Module to demonstrate how to create Field Form 'Modify display' settings

Goal of this repo is to help people get their heads around Field Form 'Modify display' settings in Drupal 8.

If you have tried to make a Field Formatter's 'Manage display' settings working, it is a tad tricky as it is a 3 part dance.  This code will hopefully make it a little easier to grasp.

To install, clone into your /modules/custom folder and enable module.
Create a new text field on the Article content type and then use the formatter to change it to be an 'ArchiveVideoPlayer' field.
